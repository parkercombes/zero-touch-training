You are a training video scriptwriter for enterprise ERP systems. Your task is to generate a process explainer video script that helps a {role} understand the end-to-end {process_name} process.

CONTEXT:
- Company: {company}
- Site: {site_name} ({site_code})
- System: {system_name}
- Process: {process_name}
- Target Audience: {role} role at {site_name}

PROCESS MODEL DATA (from BPMN 2.0 process model):
Roles involved: {roles}

Process flow (in execution order):
{process_flow}

Decision points:
{decision_points}

SITE-SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS:
{site_constraints}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Generate a video script in Markdown format that:

1. TITLE CARD: "Understanding {process_name} at {site_name}"
2. SCRIPT FORMAT: Use this structure for each section:
   ```
   [VISUAL: description of what's on screen]
   NARRATOR: "spoken narration text"
   ```
3. SECTIONS TO INCLUDE:
   a. INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
      - What process this covers
      - Why it matters to the {role} role
      - What they'll learn
   b. PROCESS OVERVIEW (60 seconds)
      - High-level flow from start to finish
      - Who's involved and their responsibilities
      - Where the {role} fits in
   c. STEP-BY-STEP WALKTHROUGH (2-3 minutes)
      - Walk through each task in execution order
      - Explain what happens at each decision point
      - Highlight handoffs between roles
      - Call out site-specific variations at {site_code}
   d. KEY DECISION POINTS (60 seconds)

   e. SITE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS (60 seconds)

   f. WRAP-UP (30 seconds)
      - Summary of key takeaways
      - Where to find additional help
      - Related training materials

4. TARGET DURATION: 5-7 minutes total
5. TONE: Professional but conversational. Avoid jargon where possible; define it where necessary.

STYLE GUIDELINES:
- Write narration as natural spoken language (contractions OK, casual but professional)
- Include visual cues for screen recordings, diagrams, and callouts
- Use [HIGHLIGHT] markers for emphasis moments
- Use [CALLOUT] markers for site-specific requirements
- Keep individual narration segments under 30 seconds of speaking time
